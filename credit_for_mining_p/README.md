# Credit for mining

We've forgotten something important! Miners want credit for the electricity they spend to mine a new block. Right now, the server is simply recording a `0` as the sender. We need to fix this to appropriately give credit where credit is due.

# Task List

_Server_
Modify the server we created to:

- Receive an `id` from a `mine` request.
- Record that ID as the `sender` in the transaction that creates the coin.

# NOTE: server will accept a slightly different POST request

_Client_
Modify the client we created to:

- Check for a file called `my_id`, open it if found, and load the ID
- Otherwise, create a UUID ID, removing `-`s and save it to a the file
- When a solution is found, send the ID in the POST as `id`
